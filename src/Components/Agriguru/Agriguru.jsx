    <strong>AgriGuru</strong> is a web-based platform built to support farmers and agriculture enthusiasts with accessible, organized, and localized information related to smart farming practices. The idea for this project was submitted to the <strong>Infosys Global Hackathon</strong> and was selected for <strong>Round 1</strong>, where it was rapidly developed during an intense 2-day hackathon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Key Features:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Crop Suggestion:</strong> Recommends suitable crops based on region, season, and soil type.</li>
      <li><strong>Weather Forecast:</strong> Integrated real-time weather data to help plan farming activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Government Schemes:</strong> Consolidated list of agricultural schemes and subsidies with descriptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Rates:</strong> Live commodity price tracking for key crops.</li>
      <li><strong>Chatbot Assistant:</strong> Simplified query handling for farmers using common questions and responses.</li>

<p>Participating in the hackathon as a team of four, including myself, helped sharpen our problem-solving skills under pressure and strengthened our resolve to build tech-driven solutions that address real-world challenges in agriculture. This experience enhanced our ability to work under time constraints and deliver impactful solutions within a short window, fueling our passion for building tech that solves real-world problems
