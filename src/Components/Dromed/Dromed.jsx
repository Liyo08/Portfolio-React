    <strong>Dromed</strong> is a visionary healthcare solution that leverages drone technology to ensure the swift and safe delivery of essential medicines ‚Äî especially to remote or underserved areas. The core objective is to enhance timely access to healthcare by overcoming geographical barriers and delays in traditional logistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    This idea was conceived and developed during our <strong>Industry Leadership Internship</strong>, where our team pitched the concept of drone-powered medical logistics. As part of the presentation, we built a supporting sample website and a concept video to illustrate the use case in real-world scenarios.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our efforts were recognized at the final presentation stage, where <strong>Dromed</strong> won the <strong>First Prize</strong> among competing teams. The idea was praised for its practicality, scalability, and potential impact on emergency medicine and rural healthcare delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Key Highlights:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Drone-based real-time medicine delivery model</li>
      <li>Interactive sample website to simulate user ordering and tracking</li>
      <li>Pitch deck outlining scalability, regulations, and logistics partnerships</li>
      <li>Designed for emergency response, rural clinics, and disaster zones</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    This project emphasized the intersection of technology and social impact, pushing us to think beyond code and focus on real-world logistics, user empathy, and innovation.
