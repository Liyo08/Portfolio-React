          <strong>Student Currency</strong> is a digital financial ecosystem designed exclusively for students, where parents act as financial administrators. It aims to instill budgeting skills, responsible spending, and savings habits through a gamified yet practical approach to money management.
        </p>

        <p>
          The concept was pitched during the <strong>Managerial Conquest</strong> organized by <strong>IEEE at Trivandrum</strong>, where it gained positive attention for addressing a relevant real-world need using tech innovation and behavioral design.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Core Features:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Parent-controlled digital wallets for students</li>
            <li>Monthly or task-based allowances tied to goals or performance</li>
            <li>In-app transaction history and visual spending analytics</li>
            <li>Smart saving challenges and milestone rewards</li>
            <li>Marketplace simulation for in-campus use or partner stores</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          This project promotes early financial literacy and responsibility while keeping parents in control of how funds are distributed and used. It also opens possibilities for school-based rewards and scholarships to be directly linked to a student's digital currency account.
